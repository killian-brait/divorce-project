## CSC 466 Project - Divorce Prediction
This is Nick and Killian's CSC 466 project where we are using various machine learning techniques to predict key indicators of healthy vs. unhealthy marriages based on the data in the following [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/divorce-prediction?resource=download).

### Models Used
1. Our Decision Tree (Random Forest?) vs. SciKit Learn's Decision Tree
2. Our Clustering vs. SciKit Learn's Clustering

#### Requirements
- [] Implement SciKit model #1
- [] Implement SciKit model #2
- [] Implement our model #1
- [] Implement our model #2
- [] Implement feature importance for our model #1
- [] Implement feature importance for our model #2
- [] Write report about the clusters in the data
- [] Write report about the feature importance of our models
- [] Write report comparing our models to SciKit's models
