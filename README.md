## Mastery Checkpoint #1
This is Killian Brait's first Mastery Checkpoint for CSC466: Knowledge Discovery From Data.

### Guassian Naive Bayes Classifier

#### Requirements
- [] Modify Lab 2 function (Simple Naive Bayes Classifier) to use the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier that assumes each feature is normally distributed rather than using binning.
- [] Modify Lab 2 code so that you may use empirical or uniform priors.
- [] Demo Code on more than one dataset (not just the fruit dataset for Lab 2).
- [] Compare the performance of the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier to the Simple Naive Bayes Classifier from Lab 2.

### Permutation Feature Importance
Compare the feature importance of the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier to the Simple Naive Bayes Classifier from Lab 2 using two different datasets. Synthesize the four comparisons (2 datasets x 2 classifiers) into a single report of your findings.

### Intro to Ethics

#### Requirements
- [] Find and analyze at least one dataset with ethical concerns using these classifiers
- [] Present an argument as to how these concerns can be monitored/managed, and discuss your position
