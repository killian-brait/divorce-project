    "##### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is the [Divorce Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/divorce-prediction) dataset from Kaggle. It contains 54 features and 170 instances, there are no missing values. The class column is the 55th column (the last one), and is named 'Divorce'. The class column is a binary column, with 1 representing a divorce and 0 representing no divorce. Each feature column is a numeric column with values ranging from 0 to 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use one-hot encoding with Pandas get_dummies() function to transform the 54 categorical feature variables into binary variables. This is done because the K Nearest Neighbors model requires numeric data. Since each feature has five categories, the model is trained on 270 features. We are then able to use feature importance to determine which answers to which questions are the most important in predicting divorce.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Building the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We use SciKit Learn's test_train_split() function to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to test the model. The test_train_split() function splits the dataset into 66% training data and 33% testing data. The random_state parameter is set to 1 so that the data is split the same way each time the model is run. The test_size parameter is set to 0.33 so that 33% of the data is used for testing and 66% is used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is run with default parameters (n_neighbors=5, weights='uniform', algorithm='auto', leaf_size=30, p=2, metric='minkowski', metric_params=None, n_jobs=None) and the accuracy is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate the feature importance on the knn model with a custom implementation. The feature importance is calculated by removing each feature from the dataset and calculating the accuracy of the model without that feature. The feature importance is then calculated by subtracting the accuracy of the model without the feature from the accuracy of the model with the feature. The feature importance is then sorted in descending order and the top 10 features are displayed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The top ten features tell us which question & answer combinations are the most important in predicting divorce.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we include a divorce predictor that is a model trained on just the most important questions. These questions have been identified by a feature importance calculation done on a RandomForest model. The questions are: *TEMPORARY (see below)*\n",
    "- Q19: My spouse and I have similar ideas about how roles should be in marriage \n",
    "- Q18: My spouse and I have similar ideas about how marriage should be\n",
    "- Q17: We share the same views about being happy in our life with my spouse\n",
    "- Q20: My spouse and I have similar values in trust.\n",
    "- Q36: I can be humiliating when we discussions.\n",
    "- Q40: We're just starting a discussion before I know what's going on.\n",
    "- Q9: I enjoy traveling with my wife.\n",
    "- Q11: I think that one day in the future, when I look back, I see that my spouse and I have been in harmony with each other.\n",
    "- Q12: My spouse and I have similar values in terms of personal freedom.\n",
    "- Q4: When I discuss with my spouse, to contact him will eventually work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*TEMPORARY: These top 10 where calculate with 10,000 random iterations of a RandomForest model that averaged out the top 10*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can engage with this project by using the divorce predictor below. Simply answer the questions and click the button to see if your marriage is in danger of divorce."
